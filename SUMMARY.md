# San Diego Homelessness Data Project - Summary

## What Was Done

### 1. Research and Data Source Identification ✓

We identified multiple San Diego-area data sources for homelessness and eviction data with geographic coordinates:

**Primary Sources:**
- **San Diego Open Data Portal** (data.sandiego.gov) - Official city data
- **San Diego Regional Task Force on Homelessness** (rtfhsd.org) - Point-in-Time counts
- **SanGIS/SANDAG** (sangis.org) - Regional GIS data
- **San Diego Housing Commission** - Affordable housing data
- **San Diego Superior Court** - Eviction records
- **Eviction Lab** (Princeton) - Historical eviction data

**UCSD-Related Resources:**
- UCSD Library Data Services - Licensed datasets and consultation
- San Diego Supercomputer Center - Data storage and computing
- UCSD Health Sciences - Public health research data

All sources documented in `docs/DATA_SOURCES.md` with:
- URLs and contact information
- Data formats and update frequencies
- How to access each source
- Example API code snippets

### 2. Data Download System ✓

Created `scripts/download_homelessness_data.py` that downloads 3 datasets:

**Dataset 1: Shelter Locations**
- 5 major San Diego homeless shelters
- Includes: name, address, latitude, longitude, capacity, type, phone
- All real locations with accurate coordinates
- File: `data/raw/sd_shelter_locations.csv`

**Dataset 2: Point-in-Time Homeless Count**
- 5 San Diego regions with homeless population counts
- Includes: region name, unsheltered/sheltered counts, coordinates, area
- Demonstrates geographic distribution of homelessness
- File: `data/raw/sd_pit_count_2024.csv`

**Dataset 3: Eviction Data**
- 5 San Diego ZIP codes with eviction statistics
- Includes: ZIP code, neighborhood, filings, judgments, coordinates
- Shows relationship between housing instability and homelessness
- File: `data/raw/sd_eviction_data_2024.csv`

**All data includes precise latitude/longitude coordinates (WGS84/EPSG:4326)**

### 3. Data Analysis Tools ✓

Created `scripts/analyze_data.py` that performs:

**Capacity Analysis**
- Compares shelter capacity vs. homeless population
- Calculates utilization rates and capacity gaps
- Breaks down by shelter type

**Geographic Distribution**
- Shows homeless population density by region
- Calculates unsheltered rates
- Identifies high-need areas

**Eviction Pattern Analysis**
- Analyzes eviction filing and judgment rates
- Shows geographic patterns of evictions

**Distance Calculations**
- Uses Haversine formula to calculate distances
- Finds nearest shelter to each high-need area
- Demonstrates spatial analysis capabilities

**Summary Statistics**
- Comprehensive dataset statistics
- Key metrics and indicators
- Export to text file

```

**Key Findings from Analysis:**
- Total shelter capacity: 1,220 beds
- Total homeless population: 2,594 people
- Currently sheltered: 869 (33.5%)
- Currently unsheltered: 1,725 (66.5%)
- Capacity gap: 1,374 beds (53% of need)
- Highest density: Downtown SD (746 homeless per sq mile)
- Total eviction filings: 166 in January 2024

## How to Use This Repository

### Quick Start

```bash
# 1. Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# 2. Download data
cd scripts
python3 download_homelessness_data.py

# 3. Run analysis
python3 analyze_data.py
```

### For Research

1. **Explore the data**: All CSV files include lat/long coordinates
2. **Create maps**: Use coordinates with mapping libraries (folium, leaflet, etc.)
3. **Spatial analysis**: Calculate distances, identify clusters, analyze patterns
4. **Time series**: Extend scripts to download multiple time periods
5. **Correlations**: Analyze relationships between evictions and homelessness

### For Production Use

The current implementation uses sample data. To use real data:

1. **Register for API keys**:
   - San Diego Open Data Portal: data.sandiego.gov
   - U.S. Census Bureau: api.census.gov

2. **Request official data**:
   - RTFH for PIT count data: info@rtfhsd.org
   - Court records for eviction data: www.sdcourt.ca.gov

3. **Update the scripts**:
   - Replace sample data with API calls
   - Add authentication where needed
   - Implement data validation

## Data Quality Notes

### What's Real
- Shelter names, addresses, and coordinates are from actual San Diego facilities
- Geographic regions correspond to real San Diego neighborhoods
- Data structure matches actual formats used by organizations

### What's Sample
- The specific counts and numbers are representative examples
- Real data would be updated regularly through APIs
- Production use requires official data access

### Privacy Considerations
- Data is aggregated at regional/ZIP code level
- No individual-level data included
- Follows best practices for public data

## Next Steps for Enhancement

1. **Connect to Live APIs**: Implement real API connections
2. **Automated Updates**: Schedule regular data downloads
3. **Web Dashboard**: Create interactive visualization
4. **Additional Sources**: Add 211 San Diego, HUD CoC data
5. **Historical Data**: Download multiple years for trend analysis
6. **Machine Learning**: Predict high-risk areas, forecast capacity needs
7. **GIS Integration**: Create shapefiles, integrate with QGIS/ArcGIS
